# Final-year-project--GA
Code base for Genetic Algorithms 

This is the proof of concept developed for the final year project. It demonstrates all the genetic algorithm (GA) functionalities and includes some sections of the assessments. It provides a simulation of the expected functionality. The prototype has been further built upon this foundation.
